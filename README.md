# PixelTD
 Minimalistic tower defense game focused on grand scale and pixel bonanza
 
 [A short example of what I'm going for (They grey pixels are turrets, white are enemies).](https://i.gyazo.com/c7c0e3274ddf11542246650524658f2f.mp4)
 
 TODO:
[x] Get the basic engine going

[x] Make basic turrets and enemies to experiment with

[] Make the screen clickable and let users place turrets with clicks (also click dragging)

[] Create levels (WIth the corresponding enemy types) (10?) and a route for enemies to take

[] Create an economy
