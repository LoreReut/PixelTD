# PixelTD
 I wanted to see if I could make a game with no framework or libraries, just from scratch, with Java. It's a minimalistic tower defense game focused on grand scale and pixel bonanza.
 
 [A short example of what I'm going for (They grey pixels are turrets, white are enemies).](https://i.gyazo.com/c6b92f10e4a70afdea835b6b3af240f2.mp4)
 
 TODO:
[x] Get the basic engine going

[x] Make basic turrets and enemies to experiment with

[] Make the screen clickable and let users place turrets with clicks (also click dragging)

[] Create levels (WIth the corresponding enemy types) (10?) and a route for enemies to take

[] Create an economy
